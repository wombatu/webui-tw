# Open WebUI Import Plugin

A TiddlyWiki plugin bringing together two great systems -- [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) and [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com).  You can use Open WebUI to do your AI chats and research, and then import the results into your Wiki for integration into other notes and projects.

This plugin provides a GUI and Wiki coding features to import and sync chats from WebUI to TiddlyWiki.

To get the plugin, drag this link onto your own wiki: [$:/plugins/wombatu/webui](https://wombatu.github.io/webui-tw/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Fwombatu%2Fwebui)

You can also download a new, empty wiki with the plugin installed - [click here](https://wombatu.github.io/webui-tw) and then use the red **save changes** button.

For features and instructions see [Usage](https://wombatu.github.io/webui-tw/#Usage).

## Future Work 
1. More testing and better error reporting (!) 
1. Store the base URL in the retrieved chats, so that more than one Open WebUI system might be used simultaneously.
1. Import according to creation date.
1. Skip chats that have previously been imported. 
1. Add the ability to create or delete WebUI chats or do other actions without leaving TiddlyWiki.
