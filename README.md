# Open WebUI Import Plugin

A TiddlyWiki plugin bringing together two great systems -- [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) and [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com).  

* Use Open WebUI to do your AI chats and research, and then...
* Import the results into your Wiki to use in notes and projects.

This plugin provides a GUI, and Wiki coding features, to sync chats from WebUI to TiddlyWiki.

To get the plugin, drag this link onto your own wiki: [$:/plugins/wombatu/webui](https://wombatu.github.io/webui-tw/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Fwombatu%2Fwebui)

You can also download a new, empty wiki with the plugin installed - [click here](https://wombatu.github.io/webui-tw) and then use the **save changes** button.

For features and instructions see [Usage](https://wombatu.github.io/webui-tw/#Usage).
